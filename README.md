## Features

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- Automated deployment process with GitHub Actions
- Modular Terraform configurations for reusability
- Example workflows for CI/CD pipelines
- Easy to customize and extend for various cloud providers

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Terraform
- Git
- A GitHub account
- Access to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) with appropriate permissions


## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aa-cloudengineer/vpc-terra-github-action.git
   cd vpc-terra-github-action

2. **Set up your cloud provider credentials:**
Follow the documentation for your specific cloud provider to configure authentication. For example, for AWS, you can set up your credentials using the AWS CLI. 

3. **Initialize Terraform:**
Run the following command to initialize the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init

4. **Plan your infrastructure:**
Generate an execution plan to see what resources will be created:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   
6. **Apply the configuration:**
Deploy the infrastructure by applying the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform Apply 
   
## GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/ directory. It automates the following steps:

1. Trigger on push or pull request events.
2. Set up the environment.
3. Run Terraform commands to plan and apply changes.

## Terraform Configuration    
The Terraform configuration files are located in the terraform/ directory. You can customize these files to define your infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, and databases.
